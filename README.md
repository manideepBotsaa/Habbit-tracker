# Smart Habit Spark - Habit Tracker
Welcome to Smart Habit Spark, a habit-tracking application designed to help users build and maintain positive daily routines. This project, developed as part of my portfolio, leverages modern programming techniques to provide an intuitive and engaging way to track habits, monitor progress, and stay motivated. The application is housed in the smart-habit-spark-main directory of this repository.
About the Project
Smart Habit Spark is a user-friendly habit tracker that empowers individuals to create, track, and visualize their daily habits. Whether you're aiming to exercise regularly, drink more water, or read daily, this app helps you stay consistent with features like progress tracking and streak visualization. The project may incorporate AI-driven insights or a clean interface, inspired by platforms like GitHub Spark, to enhance user experience.
Features

Habit Creation: Add custom habits with names, descriptions, and frequency (daily, weekly, etc.).
Progress Tracking: Monitor completion streaks and view your progress over time.
User Interface: A clean, intuitive interface (assumed to be command-line or web-based, pending specific implementation details).
Data Persistence: Save habit data locally or in a database for long-term tracking.
Motivational Insights: Optional AI-powered suggestions or analytics to keep users engaged (if applicable).
